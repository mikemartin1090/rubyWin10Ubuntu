# Testing my Ruby Install

After following the guide on getting Windows 10 setup with Ruby and Ubuntu, it asked for a test program. Building that here.

Setup environment. I only followed this guide up until using rvm to install 'latest.' Instead of the latest, I wanted 2.0.0: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10

Use RVM to install 2.0.0 specifically: https://coderwall.com/p/tptocq/installing-ruby-2-0-0-with-rvm
